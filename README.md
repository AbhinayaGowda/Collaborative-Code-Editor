# Web-Based Collaborative Code Editor

A clean project structure for a collaborative code editor that runs in the browser.

## Project Structure

### `/frontend`
Client-side application: UI, editor components, and real-time collaboration views. Will host the web interface users interact with (editor, shared cursors, chat, etc.).

### `/backend`
Server-side application: API, authentication, real-time sync (e.g. WebSockets), and persistence. Will handle sessions, document state, and communication between clients.

### `/docs`
Project documentation: architecture decisions, API specs, setup guides, and contribution guidelines. Use this for design docs and technical notes before adding frameworks.

---

No frameworks are set up yet. Add your chosen stack to `frontend` and `backend` when ready.
